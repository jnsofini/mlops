MLOPS training based on [MLOPS Zoomcamp course offered by DataTalks.Club](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp). The course was taught by different experts in the field. The chapters were taught as follows
 - [Chapter 1](01-intro): Introduction to MLOPs by Alexey
 - Chapter 2: Experiment tracking by Christian 
 - Chapter 3: Orchestration by Biance and Jeff
 - Chapter 4: Model deployment by Alexey
 - Chapter 5: Monitoring by Emily Dral
 - Chapter 6: Best practices by Sejal and Alexey

## Tech Stacks
