# GitHub Actions

I started experimenting on github actions. This more detailed one on this [site](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-black-formatter) didn't work and complained of nodes. I then used the one from the black website as well as pylint from official GitHub website. Bth failed and one of the reason is that the data is not available. 

TODO: Work on improving it.
